        <p class="lead mb-5">Corona viruses are a large group of viruses many of which cause no or minor illnesses, like
          the common cold. Some cause illness in people, and others only infect animals. Usually these infections do not
          cross over from animals to people.
          On rare occasions, coronaviruses that infect animals “change” and develop the ability to infect people. This
          has occurred with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute
          Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) where the causative viruses were probably initially infections of bats. The new
          (novel) corona virus was probably also an infection of bats but is now able to infect people. The new (novel)
          corona virus is officially called Coronavirus Disease-2019 or COVID-19 (because it was first detected in
          2019).</p>

            <ol>
              <li> Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet)</li>
              <li> Via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and are inhaled into the

            <p>COVID-19 affects different people in different ways. Most infected people will develop mild to moderate
              illness and recover without hospitalization.
              Most common symptoms: <br>
            <ul>
              <li>fever</li>
              <li> dry cough</li>
              <li>tiredness</li>
            </ul>


            Less common symptoms: <br>

            <ul>
              <li>aches and pains</li>
              <li>sore throat</li>
              <li>conjunctivitis</li>
              <li>loss of taste or smell</li>
              <li> a rash on skin, or discolouration of fingers or toes</li>

            </ul>






            Serious symptoms: <br>
            <ul>
              <li>difficulty breathing or shortness of breath</li>
              <li>chest pain or pressure</li>
              <li>loss of speech or movement</li>
            </ul>

            Seek immediate medical attention if you have serious symptoms. Always call before visiting your doctor or
            health facility. <br>
            People with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should manage their symptoms at home.
            On average it takes 5–6 days from when someone is infected with the virus for symptoms to show, however it
            can take up to 14 days.</p>

            <p>There is no official vaccine or cure for the virus. <br>
              When a disease is new, there is no vaccine until one is developed. It can take a number of years for a new
              vaccine to be developed. <br>
              A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). Although no
              vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are multiple attempts in progress to develop such a vaccine.
              In February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against severe
              acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus, to become available in less
              than 18 months. Previous attempts to develop a vaccine against the coronavirus diseases, SARS and MERS,
              established considerable knowledge about the structure and function of coronaviruses – which accelerated
              rapid development during early 2020 of varied technology platforms for a COVID-19 vaccine – but all the
              previous coronavirus vaccine candidates failed in early-stage clinical trials, with none being advanced to
              licensing.</p>

            <p>People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). <br>
              Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease)
              appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. <br>
              WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by
              following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. <br>
              COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease.
              Based on currently available
              information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical
              conditions might be at higher
              risk for severe illness from COVID-19. <br>
              Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are: <br>
            <ul>
              <li>People 65 years and older</li>
              <li>People who live in a nursing home or long-term care facility</li>

        <h2 class="mb-5">How can you reduce your chances of being infected with COVID 19?</h2>
        <p>You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions: <br>

        <ul>
          <li> Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and
            water. <br>
            <b>Why?</b> <br>
            Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your
            hands.</li>
          <li> Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and others. <br>
            <b>Why?</b> <br>
            When someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may
            contain virus.</li>
          <li>
            If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person has the
            disease.
            Avoid going to crowded places. <br>
            <b>Why?</b> <br>
            Where people come together in crowds, you are more likely to come into close contact with someone that has
            COIVD-19 and it is more difficult to maintain physical distance of 1 metre (3 feet).</li>

          <li>
            Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. <br>
            <b>Why?</b> <br>
            Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your
            eyes,
            nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and infect you.</li>
          <li>Stay home and self-isolate even with minor symptoms such as cough, headache, mild fever, until you
            recover. Have
            someone bring you supplies. If you need to leave your house, wear a mask to avoid infecting others. <br>
            <b>Why?</b> <br>
            Avoiding contact with others will protect them from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.</li>
